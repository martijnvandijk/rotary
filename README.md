# Simple Rotary Encoder Parser

This is a C library to read out a single rotary encoder. It has _no_ support for multiple rotary encoders. 
It could be added with a struct containing the state for each encoder, and passing said struct along each function call, but I can't be bothered to implement it.

This code is provided with the hope that it could be useful for someone, but if using this code leads to thermonuclear war I will not accept any responsibility or liability, you have been warned. See the `LICENSE` file.
